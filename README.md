# PocketNews

## Description
This is a simple iOS app that retrieves the top 5 news from the Google News API after the user searches for a keyword. <br />
If you want to try this app you need to get your Google News API code and insert it into the right place inside the code.

## Background
This was the first app I built by myself without following any tutorial. I built this to consolidate the knowledge I've been acquiring on the first concepts of iOS development.
